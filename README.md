# It's just a repo for a frontend!

This repo is just hte front end for that domain. The CSS in here is a little big all-over-the-place. FWIW this whole thing was written intentionally without using any libs except react-router-dom and some inbuilts.

## About 2of.io

2of.io is a personal website where I curate and display a collection of things that interest me. It's not meant to be a fully polished portfolio, but rather a fun, dynamic collection of web projects, ideas, and other bits of creativity. Think of it as a playful showcase of what I'm passionate about. The whole thing is written by me, just in REACT. Little help from generative AI solutions for the CSS, naturally.
