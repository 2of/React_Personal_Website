# 🌟 It's just a repo for a frontend! 🌟

Welcome to the frontend of my personal website! 🚀 This repo contains all the React goodness behind my personal domain **2of.io**. I’ve kept it simple by avoiding fancy libraries—just `react-router-dom` and some built-in magic. ✨

## 🔥 About **2of.io** 🔥

[**2of.io**](https://2of.io) is my little digital playground where I showcase a collection of things that spark my curiosity. 🔎 It's not meant to be your typical, fully polished portfolio, but more of a dynamic, fun hub for web projects, creative experiments, and ideas that are close to my heart. 💖

The entire thing is built with **React**, and of course, a little help from AI when it comes to the CSS. 🤖 (We all need a little AI assist, right?)
